### Basic Proxy Facade for NTLM, Kerberos, SOCKS and Proxy Auto Config file proxies

To help this project please give it a star ⭐

# Overview
Winfoom is an HTTP(s) proxy server facade that allows applications to authenticate through the following proxies: 

* NTLM or Kerberos HTTP authenticated proxy (Kerberos is supported only on Windows systems)
* SOCKS version 4 or 5, with or without authentication
* Proxy Auto Config files - including Mozilla Firefox extension that is not part of original Netscape specification

typically used in corporate environments, without having to deal with the actual handshake.

A lot of software applications have problems when dealing with an authenticated proxy server's protocol. 
Winfoom sits between the corporate proxy and applications and offloads the authentication and the proxy's protocol, acting as a facade. 
This way, the software application will only have to deal with a basic proxy with no authentication.

An example of such a facade for NTLM proxies is [CNTLM](http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/)

# Getting Started
## Download Winfoom
### Download prepackaged
To try out Winfoom without needing to download the source and package it, check out the [releases](https://github.com/ecovaci/winfoom/releases) for a prepackaged `winfoom-*.zip`.
Winfoom is a Java application and requires a Java Runtime Environment (at least v11).

If it is not already installed on your system, you can download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or, 
on Linux systems, use your package manager.

If, for certain reasons, you do not want to install Java globally on your system then download the JRE archive according
to your system architecture, unzip it in the Winfoom directory and rename it to `jdk`.

### Build from source code
If you decide to build the executable *jar* file from the source code, you would need these prerequisites:
* Java JDK 17(+)
* Maven 3.x version (optional)

First download  the source code from [releases](https://github.com/ecovaci/winfoom/releases) and unzip it.

Then open a terminal and execute this command inside the `winfoom-x.x.x` directory:

```
 mvn clean package
```

or, if you did not install Maven, use the Maven Wrapper:

```
 .\mvnw clean package
```

Now you should have the generated executable *jar* file under the *target* directory and the two release archives: one for Windows, the other for Linux/MacOS.

## Run Winfoom

The prepackaged `winfoom-windows.zip` for Windows systems, contains the following executable files: 
* `launch.bat` launches the application
* `launchGui.bat` launches the application in graphical mode
* `foomcli.bat` manages the application in GUI-less mode

The prepackaged `winfoom-unix.zip` for Linux/MacOS systems, contains the following executable files:
* `launch.sh` launches the application (needs to be made executable)
* `foomcli.sh` manages the application in GUI-less mode (needs to be made executable)

On Windows systems, Winfoom can be launched by double-click on `launchGui.bat` or
from the command prompt:

`launch`

or, to run it in debug mode:

`launch --debug`

or, to run it in the graphical mode:

`launch --gui`

On Linux/MacOS systems, there is no graphical mode available. Make sure the `*.sh` files are executable.
To run Winfoom, execute in a terminal:

`./launch.sh`

or, to run it in debug mode:

`./launch.sh --debug`

Winfoom can be launched with modified Java and system parameters by defining the environment variable `FOOM_ARGS`. For example:

`FOOM_ARGS=-Dsocket.soTimeout=10 -Dconnection.request.timeout=60`

> 👉 Note: It's a good idea to add the Winfoom's home directory to the PATH environment variable.

## Winfoom's logs
The application log file is placed under `out/logs` directory.

## Configuration
### User settings

#### The graphical mode (Windows only)
Winfoom has a graphical user interface that allows configuration.
 
The first thing to select is the proxy type:
1) `HTTP` - if the upstream proxy is NTLM or any other HTTP proxy
2) `SOCKS4` - if the upstream proxy is SOCKS version 4
3) `SOCKS5` - if the upstream proxy is SOCKS version 5
4) `PAC` - if the proxy is using a Proxy Auto Config file
5) `DIRECT` - no proxy, used for various testing environments

Then fill in the required fields. You can use the field's tooltip to get more information.

To put the application in `autostart` mode or `autodetect` mode see the `Settings` menu.

#### The command line mode (all systems)
If you run the application in non-graphical mode, Winfoom exposes an API accessible over HTTP on a local port (default 9999, configurable), 
that allows configuration and management.

The script `foomcli` provides easy access to this API. 

> 👉 Note: The `foomcli` script requires `curl`. The current version of WIndows 10 provides it by default.
> You can check if it is available by executing `curl --version` in your terminal. If you see something like `command not found` then you need to manually install it.

To get help about the usage execute:

`foomcli --help` (on Linux/MacOS is `./foomcli.sh --help`)

> 👉 Note: You can move the script `foomcli` whatever location you want. It is not required to be in the Winfoom's directory.

_Examples_

After launching Winfoom, check the status of the local proxy facade:

`foomcli status`

If the local proxy is stopped, you cat start it with:

`foomcli start`

but before that, you need to configure it. Execute:

`foomcli config`

to get the current configuration. You'll get something like:

```
{
"proxyType" : "DIRECT",
"localPort" : 3129,
"proxyTestUrl" : "https://example.com"
}
```

The output is in JSON format. The name of the fields is self-descriptive. 
Suppose you want to configure Winfoom for an HTTP proxy. First, change the proxy type to HTTP with:

`foomcli config -t http`

Then, executing `foomcli config` again, the output is something like:

```
{
  "proxyType" : "HTTP",
  "proxyHost" : "",
  "proxyPort" : 0,
  "localPort" : 3129,
  "proxyTestUrl" : "http://example.com",
  "useCurrentCredentials" : true
}
```

The field `useCurrentCredentials` only appears on Windows. When the value is `true`, it means Winfoom will use the current user's credentials
also will automatically handle the upstream proxy protocol; otherwise, you will have to provide the user and password (or DOMAIN\user and password).

To change the above values, copy the content of the output into a text file named, let's say, `http_config.json` 
in the same directory, and edit the field's values accordingly:

```
{
"proxyType" : "HTTP",
"proxyHost" : "192.168.0.105",
"proxyPort" : 80,
"localPort" : 3129,
"proxyTestUrl" : "http://example.com"
}
```

To load the new values, execute:

`foomcli config -f http_config.json`

and check the new configuration with `foomcli config` to be sure everything is as expected.

Now you can start the local proxy facade with `foomcli start`. 
At this moment you should be able to use Winfoom as a proxy facade in your browser.

On Windows, if you want to provide your own credentials, change the `useCurrentCredentials` value to `false` by editing  `http_config.json` file like this:

```
{
"proxyType" : "HTTP",
"useCurrentCredentials" : false
}
```

Execute `foomcli config -f http_config.json` again, then `foomcli config` to see the result:

```
{
  "proxyType" : "HTTP",
  "proxyHost" : "192.168.0.105",
  "proxyPort" : 80,
  "proxyUsername" : null,
  "proxyPassword" : null,
  "localPort" : 3129,
  "proxyTestUrl" : "http://example.com",
  "useCurrentCredentials" : false,
  "httpAuthProtocol" : null
}
```

Edit the `http_config.json` file again to fill in the required fields:

```
{
  "proxyType" : "HTTP",
  "proxyUsername" : "user",
  "proxyPassword" : "password",
  "httpAuthProtocol" : "NTLM"
}
```

Execute `foomcli config -f http_config.json` again and start the local proxy server.

If you want to shut down Winfoom execute `foomcli shutdown`

---

On Linux/MacOS or Windows with `useCurrentCredentials=false`, if the proxy type is HTTP you need to set the `httpAuthProtocol` field, 
which is the proxy protocol: one of `NTLM, BASIC` values.

If the proxy type is PAC, then the output of the `foomcli config` command would be like:

```
{
  "proxyType" : "PAC",
  "proxyUsername" : "DOMAIN\\winfoom",
  "proxyPassword" : "***",
  "proxyPacFileLocation" : "C:\\path_to\\proxy-ntlm-auth.pac",
  "blacklistTimeout" : 30,
  "localPort" : 3129,
  "proxyTestUrl" : "https://example.com",
  "pacHttpAuthProtocol" : "NTLM"
}
```

The possible values of `pacHttpAuthProtocol` field are: `NTLM`, `BASIC`. You need to set this field only when the PAC file points to at least one upstream HTTP proxy.

---

To put Winfoom in autostart mode first execute:

`foomcli settings`

The output would be something like:

```
{
"autostart" : false,
"autodetect" : false,
"appVersion" : "3.0.1",
"apiPort" : 9999
}
```

Copy the output into a file named, let's say, `settings.json` and modify accordingly:

```
{
"autostart" : true
}
```

Since we only modify the autostart option, the other fields are dropped off.

To load the new values, execute:

`foomcli settings -f settings.json`

then check the new settings with `foomcli settings`

> 👉 Note: If you modify the apiPort then you need to set the variable FOOM_LOCATION. 
> (For example FOOM_LOCATION=localhost:[your new port])

> 👉 WARNING: All the provided passwords are stored encoded BASE64 without any encryption. 
> Make sure you protect the access to the config directory!


### System settings
The system settings configuration file is `config/system.properties`.

_Please do not modify this file unless absolutely necessary. It is advisable to post your issue in [Issues Section](https://github.com/ecovaci/winfoom/issues) first._

The available settings:

| Key                |  Description      |  Type  |  Default value |

### Authentication
* For HTTP proxy type, Winfoom uses the current Windows user credentials to authenticate to the upstream proxy, 
  unless you uncheck the `Use system credentials` checkbox. 
  On Linux/MacOS or on Windows with `Use system credentials` unchecked you need to provide the user and password (or DOMAIN\user and password if the DOMAIN is required) 
* For SOCKS5 proxy type, the user/password need to be provided when required.
* For PAC proxy type, starting with v3.4.0, there is some support for authentication 
  (still, keep in mind that the PAC protocol does not support authentication) when:
  1. All upstream proxy servers accept the same credentials.
  2. On Windows, if the `proxyUsername` field is empty, the current user's credentials are used for authentication.
  3. On Unix based systems, if the `proxyUsername` field is empty the authentication is disabled. 
  4. On all systems, when the `proxyUsername` field is not empty, the provided `proxyUsername`/`proxyPassword` are used for authentication.
     If at least one of the upstream proxy servers is of HTTP type, the field `pacHttpAuthProtocol` needs to be provided.

### Error codes
Starting with v2.6.0 Winfoom gives back the following HTTP error codes when there is no response from the upstream proxy for various reasons:

| Proxy type         |  HTTP error code  |  When  |
|--------------------|:-----------------:|:------:|
|ALL|502|The upstream proxy is not available|
|SOCKS/DIRECT|504|The giving address is not reachable|
|PAC|502|All upstream proxies are blacklisted|
|ALL|500|Any other error|

### Test
To test it, open a browser, let's say Firefox and configure proxy like this:

![firefox](https://github.com/ecovaci/winfoom/blob/master/assets/img/firefox.png)

Now you should be able to access any URL without Firefox asking for credentials.

_If you don't have an available proxy, you still can test Winfoom by installing [WinGate](https://www.wingate.com/) and configure it to act 
as a NTML proxy._
